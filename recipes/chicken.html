    <img src="../img/chicken.jpg" alt="Mississippi Chicken">
    <p>This is such a fun and simple recipe with only 4 ingredients that can be made in the oven or in the slow cooker. The chicken turns out buttery, spicy, juicy, and herby.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar sliced pepperoncini peppers, drained</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Season chicken with ranch seasoning mix; place in bottom of large Dutch oven. Place pepperoncini peppers, butter, and 1/2 cup reserved pepper juice over chicken. Cover, and bake in preheated oven until chicken is fork tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Let stand 5 minutes. Shred chicken using two forks.</p>
